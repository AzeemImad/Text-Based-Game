# Text-Based-Game
Hello! This is a game I created when I first started to programming. It is a text based video game which allows the person to progress through the story by following and interacting with the text.

Story follows a couple of jewel theifs who need to solve text puzzles to advance forward with the heist. A simple mistake means its game over for the aspiring criminals!

Fairly simple and runs in the compiler itself

Please give it a try!!!

Thanks,

Azeem
